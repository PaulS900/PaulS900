## Part 3 - Command Line Navigation

My OS is:
- [x] Windows
- [] Linux
- [] Mac

My Command Line Shell is: Windows Powershell 

### Navigating My OS on the Command Line

1. Full / absolute path to your user's home directory: C:\Users\crunc
2. Create a directory named `DirA`: mkdir DirA
3. Create a directory named `Dir B`: mkdir "Dir B"
4. Go into `DirA`: cd DirA
5. Go into `Dir B` from `DirA`: cd ..\"Dir B"
6. Return to your user's home directory: cd ~
7. Create a file named `test.txt`: New-Item test.txt
8. Move the file named `test.txt` into `DirA`: mv test.txt C:\Users\crunc\DirA
9. Contents of `test.txt`: nothing inside of test.txt
```
Put your words here
```
10. Make a copy of `test.txt` named `copy.txt` in `DirA`: C:\Users\crunc\DirA> cp test.txt copy.txt
11. View the contents of `DirA`: C:\Users\crunc\DirA> ls
12. Make a copy of `test.txt` in `Dir B` named `fodder.txt`: C:\users\crunc\DirA> cp test.txt "..\Dir B\fodder.txt"
13. Delete / remove both `fodder.txt` AND `Dir B`: C:\users\crunc> rm ".\Dir B\fodder.txt",".\Dir B"

## Citations

To add citations, provide the site and a summary of what it assisted you with.  If generative AI was used, include which generative AI system was used and what prompt(s) you fed it.

I used googled how to make a copy from one dir into the other dir and rename it and saw the AI box give me the answer
